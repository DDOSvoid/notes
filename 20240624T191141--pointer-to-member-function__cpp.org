* Pointer to member function
** Description
A brief description:
+ A ptmf stores either the address of a non-virtual function or a vtable offset to a virtual function
+ A ptmf stores the rules to modify the instance pointer (for the implicit type conversion required when inheritance comes into play)
+ A ptmf stores the information whether the ptmf points to a virtual or a non-virtual function
+ A ptmfs type defines the function signature (of the ptmf)
+ A ptmfs type defines the class which ptmf is related to
  
** Syntax
The syntax to define a ptmf is:
=return_type (ClassName::*pointer_name)(argument_types) = &ClassName::member_function;=

The syntax to invoce a ptmf is:
+ =.*= for the case the left hand side is an object reference
+ =->*= for the case the left hand side is an object pointer
+ use ~std::invoke~ when you're confused with =.*= and =->*=  
And remember to use the parenthese. E.g. =(food->*GetName())();=
