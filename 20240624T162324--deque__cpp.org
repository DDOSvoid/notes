* Deque
** Implementation
*** Possible implemenetation
If amortized O(1) is acceptable, we can use dynamic circular queue to implement ~std::deque~. When it's full, reallocation
like ~std::vector~ will happen.

*** TODO Standard libraray implementation
TODO

** Iterator invalidation
All iterators are seen as invalid after insertion.
+ This includes ~push_back~, ~push_front~, ~insert~, ~resize~, ~shrink_to_fit~ and ~clear~.

Erasing from the front or the back will only invalidated the erased element, otherwise all iterators are invalidated.
